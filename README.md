## About

I’m a self-taught software developer with professional experience from **2002–2019**, progressing from junior roles into **Senior Developer** positions.

I specialize in working with existing systems: understanding how they behave, refactoring unclear logic, and improving predictability and long-term maintainability. I value clear boundaries, explicit state, and documentation that explains *why* something exists, not just *what* it does.

After stepping away from full-time software work for several years, I’m intentionally returning to hands-on development with refreshed focus and modern tooling.
