## Chris Rivers

## Senior Developer focused on clarity, systems, and maintainable code.

I’m a self-taught developer with professional experience from 2002 to 2019, progressing from junior roles into Senior Developer roles. After stepping away from full-time software work for several years, I’m intentionally returning to hands-on development with refreshed focus and modern tooling.

My strength isn’t flashy greenfield demos. It’s understanding existing systems, refactoring unclear logic, and improving predictability and maintainability over time.

## Featured Work

Demo App Rehab

- React • JavaScript • State Management

A small React application built to demonstrate how I approach inherited codebases. The focus is on refactoring unclear logic, making loading and UI state explicit, reducing duplication, and documenting technical decisions.

Microservices Demo

- Node.js • Express • API Gateway Pattern

A minimal backend demo showing service boundaries and data aggregation using a user service, order service, and API gateway. Designed for local execution and clearly documented.

## Real-World Websites
Production work under real constraints

These projects represent real applications that evolved over time, balancing structure, usability, and long-term maintainability rather than idealized greenfield builds.

## How I Work

I’m comfortable picking up existing systems, understanding how they behave, and improving them incrementally. I care about clarity, explicit state, and leaving things easier to reason about than I found them.

I work well independently, communicate decisions clearly, and take ownership of system behavior rather than just shipping features.
