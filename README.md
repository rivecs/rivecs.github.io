## About

I’m a self-taught software developer with professional experience from **2002–2019**, progressing from junior roles into **Senior Developer** positions. I’m now returning to hands-on development with modern tooling, current frontend patterns, and a strong focus on clarity and maintainability.

My strength is working in real systems. I’m comfortable stepping into existing codebases, untangling unclear logic, and refactoring toward predictable behavior. I care about explicit state, clear data flow, and designs that scale in understanding, not just features.

## Featured Work

### Demo App Rehab  
**React • Modern JavaScript • Explicit State**

A focused React project designed to demonstrate how I approach inherited frontend code.

- Refactors duplicated data fetching and unclear logic
- Makes loading and UI state explicit and observable
- Improves readability and long-term maintainability
- Documents architectural and refactor decisions

Repository:  
https://github.com/rivecs/demo-app-rehab  

Live demo:

### Mini Microservices Demo  
**Node.js • Express • API Gateway Pattern**

A lightweight backend demo illustrating service boundaries and aggregation patterns.

- User service and order service running independently
- API gateway combining upstream responses for frontend use
- Explicit error handling and failure awareness
- Designed for local execution and clarity over infrastructure noise

Repository:

### Real-World Websites  
**Production systems with real constraints**

These projects reflect long-lived applications that evolved over time rather than greenfield demos.

## How I Build Software

- I favor clear data flow and explicit state over implicit behavior  
- I refactor incrementally instead of rewriting everything  
- I optimize for readability, debuggability, and future change  
- I document decisions so the *next* developer isn’t guessing
